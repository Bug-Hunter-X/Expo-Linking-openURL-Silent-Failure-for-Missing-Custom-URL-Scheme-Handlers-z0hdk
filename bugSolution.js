The solution is to add an error handling mechanism that uses `Linking.canOpenURL` before attempting to open the URL. This pre-check confirms the existence of an app capable of handling the URL scheme.  Here's the updated code:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

async function openCustomURL(url) {
  const canOpen = await Linking.canOpenURL(url);
  if (canOpen) {
    await Linking.openURL(url);
  } else {
    // Handle the case where the URL cannot be opened
    Alert.alert('Error', 'App for this scheme is not installed.');
  }
}
```
This improved version checks for the availability of a handler before opening the URL, preventing the silent failure and improving the user experience.
